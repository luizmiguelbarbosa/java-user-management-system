<h2>📖 Description</h2>

<p>
This project was built as part of foundational backend training, focusing on core Java concepts without Object-Oriented Programming.
</p>

<p>
The main goal was to improve logical structuring, function organization, and data manipulation using arrays.
Through the development of this CRUD system, significant improvements were made in code architecture, control flow, and array handling.

<h2>⚠ Challenges and Issues</h2>

<p>
The biggest challenge in this project was organizing the code architecture,
especially structuring functions in a clean and maintainable way.
</p>

<p>
There were also difficulties with control flow and array manipulation,
particularly when managing indexing and removal logic.
However, this CRUD significantly improved backend fundamentals and logical thinking.
